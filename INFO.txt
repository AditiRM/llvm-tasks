Writing llvm pass

Types of Passes
Pass is an instance of LLVM class Pass.

[Inheritance of Passes]
Defined in : /llvm-project/llvm/include/llvm/Pass.h
llvm::Pass
	llvm::BasicBlockPass
	llvm::ModulePass
	llvm::RegionPass
	llvm::CallGraphSCCPass
	llvm::LoopPass
	llvm::FunctionPass
	
/llvm-project/llvm/lib -> Contain all the in buit passes


/llvm-project/llvm/lib/Transform
1.Make a directory to write a new pass: Ex. Task
	Inside Task directory make a new file : task.cpp
	[Details written inside task.cpp
		Include -> 	/Pass.h 
				/IR/Function.h
				/Support/raw_ostream.h
	
		{This namespace is defined in Pass.h}
		using namespace llvm;
	]
	
2.Wrap "Task"[inherited from FunctionPass] class inside namespace
	Create a constructor inside that and pass static char "ID" to it.
	
3.Now we will override runOnFunction(Function &F)!
	Analysis of what runOnFunction is :
		The starting point of every function pass
		When the pass is getting called by the optimizer, what will happen is control will get the path from this overridden virtual function.
		
	Extra : Similar case to write a ModulePass ->
	class Demo : public ModulePass{
		static char ID;
		Task() : ModulePass(ID) {}
		bool runOnModule(Module &F) {}
	}
	
	runOnFunction -> Pure Virtual Function.[defined in Pass.h inside FunctionPass inherited from Pass]
	Desc. -> Virtual method overridden by subclasses to do the per-function processing of the pass.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	> What is a pure virtual function?
	  Virtual function for which we need not write any function definition &
	  only we have to declare it.[declared by assigning 0 in the declaration.]
	> We must override this function to avoid making derived class abstract too.
	> useful when the implementation of all functions cannot be provided in a base class bcoz we don't know the implementation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.Make everything public as by default it will be private.

6.Need to override runOnFunction ->
	> what if we don't override, what will happen?
		it will still work!
	> "override" - is just a flag to tell the compiler that we are overriding the function.
	
7.IMP step : Get function name from llvm function	[use doxygen mostly]
llvm::Function Class Reference [Refer diagram]  
Search for required function from list of API!
[keep in mind about getters & setters definations]
* getName() -> return a constant reference to the value's name
------------------------------------------------------------------
bool runOnFunction(Function &F) override {
                        auto name = F.getName();
                        errs() << "Hello From: " << name << "\n";
                        return false;
                }
----------------------------------------------------------------
What above snippet is doing? 
Iterate over every function, print the name of the function & get out...
Why "return false"? -> 
This is just an analysis pass & we did not change anything so we are just passing on the info to the pass manager(who is going to schedule the pass)!
[Recollect concept from get: opt -> what we have is a sequence of passes.
After a transformation analysis info might become invalid.
So we want to make sure information gets preserved even after adding another pass.]

8.Now we have to register this pass. -> Instantiate a static object
	> Class Template function & create static object now!
	> Instantiate the class template 
	RegisterPass -> is a predefined constructor![]
	
	Arguments 
		1st -> command line argument with which we are going to identify the pass in opt when we call.
		2nd -> Description of pass [will get in --help]

9.Now we need to compile the pass.
	>LLVM uses which build system ? -> cmake based
	>first we have to inform that we have created a pass. Create CMakeListst.txt & add pass! 
	add_llvm_library(task MODULE task.cpp)

10.Now as we have added a subdirectory into the parent directory.
	We need to mention that in the "CMakeList.txt" file of Transform dir.!
	add_subdirectory(Task)

--------------------------------Commands_Info--------------------------------------------------
1.Build :[ /llvm-project/build ]
	>cmake ../llvm/

2.Compile :
	>make task
	[will generate task.so file & location : /lib]

3.Generate ll file:
	>./bin/clang -S -emit-llvm -Xclang -disable-O0-optnone test.c -o test.ll

4.To check if our pass description is present in --help :
	./bin/opt -load ./lib/task.so -task -help

5.Execution of pass "task":[It should print function names present in the pass!]
	>./bin/opt -load ./lib/task.so -task test.ll 
	[Output:
	Hello From: foo
	Hello From: main]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VIMP :
Pass infrastructure in llvm is taken for granted!
Vey modular structure & everything is properly bundled together

Doubt: Can we write passes other than Transform pass? like analysis, SSA 
-> Yes, ofc we can! Check out dir inside /lib folder & read about some predefined passes.
Ex. Scalar, IPO

Doubt: How to find required header files for specific requirements for writing a pass?
-> Go to llvm::Function Class Reference [header files are mentioned at the top of the Doxygen documentation]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. >./bin/opt -load ./lib/task.so -mem2reg -task -licm --debug-pass=Structure test.ll

      This is a task pass.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Observation: So here we can see how the passes are scheduled by the Pass Manager!

Common Passes (present for all)-> [Boiler plate set of passes that would run for all the cases.]
Target Library Information
Target Transform Information
Target Pass Configuration

How Pass Manager Works ?
FunctionPass Manager -> will schedule all the passes!
[Arghhh WTF is happening over here. Let's break down line by line.]

1st : "Dominator Tree Construction" will get scheduled.
2nd : "Promote Memory to Register" will get scheduled after that.
[For SSAing the code, mem to Reg pass was using dominator tree, therefore it got scheduled first!]
3rd : Now we will land our "task" pass!!!

4th : Now for licm[flag that we have added while running]  again "dominator" pass will get scheduled
5th : Now some form of Alias analysis & Loop passes that were preread by licm will get scheduled.

		Basic Alias Analysis (stateless AA impl)
      	Function Alias Analysis Results
      	Memory SSA
      	Natural Loop Information
      	Canonicalize natural loops
      	LCSSA Verifier
      	Loop-Closed SSA Form Pass
6th : licm will schedule "Loop Pass Manager"
7th : "Module Verifier" pass will get scheduled by llvm-opt after that at the end!

VVVIMP :
Finally what happened is, as we know that licm is a Transformation pass.
So, after a transformation pass, llvm-opt scheduled a "Verifier Pass".
-> This will check if all the basic transformed IR obeys the basic scenario! 

Think about this: IR is a program, a way of expressing high-level code. This program will have a set of semantics(rules) & this verifier will check if those semantics are getting obeyed. That's it!!!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now let's play around with this task pass.
